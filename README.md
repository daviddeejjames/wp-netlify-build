# WordPress To Netlify Build Plugin 🏗️

This is a small WordPress plugin that triggers builds on a site deployed on Netlify. This is
useful for Static Site Generators such as Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll that are using
the WordPress REST API as a data source, but require build commands or manual rebuilds on Netlify
to show the newly updated content.

## Install

### Automatic Installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WP Netlify” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual Installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. [The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
